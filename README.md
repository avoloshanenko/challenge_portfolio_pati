# Task 1: software configuration.
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
I decided to take up the challenge. I want to change my life and for that, I have to do other things which I haven't done before. I have chosen this project because what you have promised me isn't easy way. Valuable knowledge isn't given easily as well as experience. I have enough dreams which I haven't carried through yet. It's time for their realization. I look forward to gaining experience as a tester and I'm ready to learn hard
You will hardly hear from me: "I'm interested in doing testing", you will see it in my accomplishments.
